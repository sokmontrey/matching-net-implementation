# Introduction

A PyTorch notebook implementation of [Matching Network for One Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080). 
It is also my first ever Deep learning paper implementation. 
The model is tested on the Fashion MNIST dataset with 50% of the classes are for training and the other 50% are for testing (the model is train and test on completely seperate classes).

Please note that there are a few minor modifications from the original paper for the math to works in batch.
